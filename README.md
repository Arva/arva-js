# Arva

Arva Foundation is the core of the Arva User Experience Platform where developers have complete freedom to hack their creations.
Built to be a complete substitute for frameworks like React and Angular, Arva plays well with others by emphasising on ECMAScript syntax
and aiming for compatability with the W3C Components specification.

## Why Arva?

* ***Visual magic***. No easy way existed to develop transitions without being a rockstar developer.
* ***Animation performance in the browser is bad***. We handle it with a 60fps baseline.
* ***Open source*** As part of the Arva User Experience Platform (no vendor lock-in).
* **Data integration** *Realtime data synchronisation without headaches, seamlessly integrating with Firebase, SharePoint, and (coming soon) graphQL.*

## Building blocks

* **App** *The entry point of your application, defining the controllers and their routes.*
* **Controllers** *Manage the control flow and business logic of your application.*
* **Views** *Define the way your app looks, feels, and interacts.*
* **Models** *Take care of two-way realtime data binding.*
