## Overview

Arva has become much more than just an MV*. These are the components that make up the entire framework:

* [arva-ds](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-ds): DataSources for Firebase and SharePoint (or build your own!), so you can benefit from the same model and collection interfaces*
* [arva-utils](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-utils): Utilities to make things like object property manipulation and execution throttling easy
* [arva-components](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-components): Make development more efficient by using components like `BrandingEngine` and `Localizer`
