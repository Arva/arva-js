[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Bizboard/arva-mvc](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Bizboard/arva-mvc?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Using the latest ES6 standards we created an MVC for Mobile/Web/TV Applications that provides a remarkable development experience. You'll be able to code faster, 
write more robust and manageable code and you'll be able to easily build views that scale on a large number of device resolutions.


What it offers:

* **Context** *use dependency injection to configure your applications resources like Datasources*
* **App** *decorate your application with global components and controllers*
* **Routing** *Never think about routing ever again, every controller is accessible by it's name convention*
* **Controllers** *manage your application flow*
* **Views** *Easy way of declaring your View and layout*

And enjoy the benefit of 60 fps animations cross-platform, made possible by [famo.us](http://github.com/famous) and [famous-flex](http://github.com/Ijzerenhein/famous-flex).


## Overview

Arva has become much more than just an MVC. We've organized our repositories:

* [arva-mvc](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-mvc): MVC framework 100% ES6 developed MVC
* [arva-ds](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-ds): DataSources for Firebase and SharePoint or build your own datasource, so you can benefit from the same model and collection interfaces*
* [arva-components](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-components): Make development more efficient by using components like `BrandingEngine` and `Localizer`
* [arva-gesture](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-gesture): Add support for new gestures that become available with technologies like [MYO](//myo.com)
* [arva-speech](//github.com/Bizboard/arva-speech): Add support for spoken commands using the Web Speech API. **(not released yet)**
