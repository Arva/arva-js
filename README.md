# Why Arva?


Arva solves the problem of layout and animation without the need to bother with CSS nor HTML. While CSS is still used for **styling** of the content, whereas **positioning** and **sizing** is handled through different processes.
Arva abstracts away some of the concerns that many front-end developers face,
which includes CSS deep-dives and directives like `display: inline-block` `margin:auto`, `position:relative`, `clear:left`, `float: right`, `zoom: 1` `overflow: auto`, `-webkit-box-sizing: border-box` and so on.

Even modern paradigms like `flexbox` won't be necessary anymore. In addition, Arva refrains from using any templating language, and only uses standard EcmaScript syntax. Let's get started.
