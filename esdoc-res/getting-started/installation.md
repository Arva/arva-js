## Installation
The easiest way to get started quickly is by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/Bizboard/arva-seed">Arva Seed</a> project. This project contains all the necessary components and default
settings to build a hello world application across multiple platforms.

```bash
npm install -g cordova
git clone https://github.com/Bizboard/arva-seed.git
cd arva-seed
npm install
jspm install
```

>If you're using WebStorm, now would be a good time to dive into your preferences and set your JavaScript version to ECMAScript 6.
